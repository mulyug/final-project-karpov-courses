# final-project-karpov-courses

This repository contains three tasks from the final karpov.courses project.

In the first task, I conduct A/B testing using the Python libraries Pandas, Seaborn and Skipy. In the second task, I connect to the database and create SQL queries, and also work with product metrics. In the last task I slightly improved the functionality of the first one.

A detailed description of the tasks, as well as the described solution progress, is contained inside the .ipynb files.
